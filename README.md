# Heya! ![earth][earth-file]

I'm Kyle Erhabor, a 17-year-old software developer. I go under the pseudonyms Klay and Lite online. I'm a high school
student pursuing a software engineering career.

I develop mobile applications, front & backend systems, command-line applications, bots, and more. I've worked on
numerous projects, most of which are private, archived, or no longer exist. I predominantly work with systems and
functional programming languages (Clojure, Rust, Swift, etc.) and occasionally contribute to open-source software.
