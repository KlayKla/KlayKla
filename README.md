# Hello!

Hello, my name is Kyle. I go by Lite, LiteLT, and Moon online. I'm a high school student aspiring to be a software
engineer and spend most of my time writing CLI apps, bots, and mobile apps. My favorite languages are Rust and Python
and I'm experienced with a variety of tools and technologies, but affiliate myself with technology not bound to the web
(SwiftUI, Flutter, CLI apps, etc.)

If you want to contact me, feel free to send me an email.

## Technologies

The labels are sorted by experience from the leading to trailing edge. Leading means more experience (e.g. Rust) and
trailing means less experience (e.g. Java).
