# Hello!

## About Me

Hey, my name is Lite (a.k.a. Moon). I am a student and programmer aspiring to be a software engineer. I've been programming for 2+ years and have devoted most of my time to writing backend applications, CLIs, and more. If you need to contact me, feel free to DM on Discord (**Lite#6155**).

In the beginning, I started learning how to code with HTML to try building a simple website. Although I was able to do it, it did not feel rewarding, so I quit for over a year, until I found interest in writing Discord bots. The first programming language I learned was JavaScript, but I don't use it as often as I used to. I later went on to learn languages like Python for its simplicity, Swift for user interfaces, Java & Kotlin, and more.

My favorite programming languages are Python & Rust. I'm currently devoting my time to diving deeper into Rust and looking for the next big "thing". :)

## Projects

Currently, I'm working on two open projects: **Anime Catalog** and **Amincio**. Both projects share a similar purpose (managing an anime list), but are diverse in many ways. It's like having two boxes that look the exact same, but one box is empty, while another box has some stuff in it.

## Social Media

In case you haven't noticed, I like anime... a lot. Check out my [AniList profile][anilist-profile]. You may also be interested in my [Steam profile][steam-profile], but I don't use Steam all that much.
