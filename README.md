# Heya!

I am Kyle Erhabor, a 17-year-old software developer. I'm known as Lite and LiteLT online. I'm a high school student
pursuing a software engineering career.

I develop mobile apps, command-line apps, bots, backend systems, and more. I've developed numerous projects, most of
which are private, archived, or deleted. I occasionally contribute to open-source software.

If you'd like to contact me, feel free to send me an email.
