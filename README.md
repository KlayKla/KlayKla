## Hello!

I'm Kyle Erhabor, a 17-year-old software developer. I go under the pseudonyms Klay and Lite online. I spend my days
studying and developing software.

- *"This was a really powerful, fantastic super-duper machine. Typical piece here, it's got 256 kilobytes of memory. And 8 megahertz clock speed. You can do amazing things with that. So if we look at today's computers, this is the typical laptop. 8 gigabits of memory. It's got 4 cores running at 2.5 gigahertz. A big solid state disk and so on. Now, in 1985, that machine would boot, in you know, 60 seconds, and this machine is 10,000 times faster or a thousand times faster, it should should boot in 60 milliseconds? How many of your machines boot in 60 milliseconds? All right, so something's gone wrong."*
