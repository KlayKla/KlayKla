# Heya! ![earth][earth-file]

I'm Kyle Erhabor, a 17-year-old software developer. I go under the pseudonyms Lite and LiteLT online. I'm a high school
student pursuing a software engineering career.

I develop mobile applications, front & backend systems, command-line applications, bots, and more. I've worked on
numerous projects, more of which are private, archived, or deleted. I predominantly work with systems programming
languages (e.g. Rust & Swift) and occasionally contribute to open-source software.

If you'd like to contact me, feel free to send me an email.
