### Hello!
My name is Lite, but I go by LiteLT on this site. The LT in my name stands for lightest.

I've been coding for a while now and know **6** programming languages (from most to least experience):
- JavaScript
- Python
- Kotlin
- Swift
- Rust
- Java

I'm currently learning **Python** and looking into building a **Graphical User Interface**. Although I have little knowledge in building GUIs, I'll still enjoy the mountain I travel learning it. ðŸ˜„
